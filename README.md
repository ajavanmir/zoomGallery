        <!-- Add more thumbnails as needed -->
    </div>

</div>
```

3. Include the JavaScript before closing `</body>`:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
<script>
    zoomGallery.init("#my-gallery");
</script>
```

### Tips for an even better README:
1. Add a "Getting Started" section with more detailed setup instructions
2. Include a "Troubleshooting" section for common issues
3. Add a "Roadmap" section for planned features
4. Include screenshots or a GIF showing the gallery in action
5. Add badges for build status, version, etc. if applicable

Would you like me to add any specific sections or modify any part of this README?
